abstract: |
  Pathological anxiety is often maintained by avoidance behaviors driven by core threatsâ€”the ultimate feared consequences underlying these behaviors.
  For example, contamination fears may be driven by core threats such as death, harm to loved ones, disgust, or dysfunction.
  Despite their importance in clinical formulations, core threats are under-researched, with no standardized tools for their assessment.
  This study introduces the Core Threat Structured Interview (CTSI), a tool designed to systematically identify core threats in both face-to-face and online formats.
  Across four validation studies, the CTSI demonstrated robust reliability (e.g., interrater, test-retest) and validity (face, convergent, divergent).
  Results revealed the distinctions between core and proximal threats, highlighting the deeply personal and motivational nature of core threats.
  By enabling individualized assessments, the CTSI provides a nuanced approach to understanding and treating anxiety, paving the way for improved clinical outcomes and research into the mechanisms driving fear.
