abstract: |
  Core threats, the ultimate feared consequences underlying avoidant behaviors, often underlie pathological anxiety.
  For example, contamination fears can be driven by core threats such as death, harming loved ones, or disgust.
  Despite their clinical importance, core threats are under-researched.
  This study is the first systematic examination of core threats, via a standardized semi-structured interview, the Core Threat Structured Interview (CTSI).
  Core threats were examined via face-to-face and online formats in four samples.
  Across studies, the CTSI demonstrated robust reliability (e.g., interrater, test-retest) and validity (convergent, divergent).
  In addition, a reliable coding scheme was used to categorize core threats.
  Results revealed that core threat themes were distinct from proximal threats, and were stable.
  Different obsessions in the same individual sometimes had shared core threats.
  By enabling individualized assessments, we were able to provide a nuanced approach to understanding anxiety, paving the way for research into the motivational mechanisms driving fear.
