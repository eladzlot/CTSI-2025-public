> Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. *Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina*

A patient walks into the clinic.
You can immediately see her careful demeanor and chafed hands.
She reports that she compulsively washes her hands, that she doesn't go to public restrooms, and that she carefully cleans doorknobs before touching them.
What is she afraid of?
When asked, she says that she is afraid of being contaminated.
But is contamination the true threat underlying her fear?
Initial reports of a patient’s fears often mask deeper concerns [@borkovecWorryCognitivePhenomenon1998].
This patient might fear becoming sick and dying, contaminating her loved ones, being deemed disgusting and rejected, or simply suffering.
The key is that we can’t know the true threat until we ask.

These underlying concerns, known as core threats, are also referred to as core fears, catastrophic beliefs or central innately aversive outcomes.
Core threats are central to treating anxiety disorders [@huppertCoreFearsValues2012; @zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
Many clinicians recognize the importance of understanding core threats to inform effective interventions 
[e.g., @craskeOptimizingExposureTherapy2022; @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012; @pinciottiCallActionRecommendations2021; @murrayDissectingCoreFear2016].
However, despite their significance, clinical guidelines for identifying and addressing core threats remain limited.
This paper aims to fill this gap by offering practical guidelines and exploring the phenomenology of core threats.

## What are Core Threats?

Fear and anxiety are adaptive responses to perceived threats.
The nature of these threats often follows a hierarchical pattern.
Consider a jungle, where dangers such as venomous snakes, prowling lions, or quicksand abound.
In this context, the jungle represents the proximal threat, the immediate signal of danger.
However, the core threat—the ultimate feared outcome—is death (for example).
It is the plausibility of death that makes the jungle threatening and evokes fear.

Core threats arise from the interplay between what individuals *expect* (e.g., the likelihood of death) and their evaluation, or the *meaning* that they assign (e.g., the significance or consequences of potential death).
This framework helps explain why the same situation may evoke different core threats for different people.
For instance, individuals might *expect* different dangers but assign a similar *meaning*:
one person in the jungle may *expect* to encounter a snake, while another *expects* a lion, yet both perceive the ultimate threat (meaning) as death.
Conversely, individuals might *expect* the same danger but assign different *meanings*:
for someone *expecting* an encounter with snakes, the *meaning* might center on their unpredictability, for another on their sliminess, for a third on the immediate risk to their life, and for yet another on the broader impact of their potential death on loved ones.
 
These distinctions are critical when examining anxiety disorders [e.g., @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012; @pinciottiCallActionRecommendations2021; @murrayDissectingCoreFear2016].
In pathological anxiety, seemingly benign stimuli are perceived as dangerous.
To determine their safety, it is essential to understand the specific nature of the threat attributed to them [@craskeOptimizingExposureTherapy2022; @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012; @murrayDissectingCoreFear2016; @huppertCoreFearsValues2012].
Consider an individual who fears blood.
If their core threat involves the stress of encountering blood-like stimuli, exposure to sheep blood might be effective.
However, if their primary fear centers on contracting AIDS, such exposure would likely be ineffective.
The same principle applies to thought challenges and behavioral experiments.

A significant challenge in safety learning is its limited generalization across contexts [see @boutonContextAmbiguityUnlearning2002].
By focusing on core threats, clinicians can identify the most threatening aspects of feared stimuli, thereby promoting better generalization of safety learning across contexts [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025; @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012].
Identifying core threats also enhances clinicians’ understanding of patients’ experiences when confronting their fears.
This understanding fosters a sense of being supported for the patient and provides a coherent narrative to explain their pathological behavior.
Consequently, determining core threats can significantly shape the trajectory of psychotherapy—from the initial case formulation [@personsCaseFormulationApproach2012] to the implementation of specific interventions like exposures, thought challenges, or behavioral experiments.

## Determining Core Threats

Accurately identifying core threats is a complex process.
It requires a clear understanding of what core threats are and the types of questions best suited to uncover them.
A semi-structured interview can be a useful tool for this purpose [@samuelSurveyInterviewMethods2020], offering benefits for both clinical and research applications.
In clinical settings, such interviews help therapists identify the specific motivations underlying anxiety-related behaviors.
This, in turn, facilitates the development of a clear case formulation [@personsCaseFormulationApproach2012] and enables the creation of tailored interventions [e.g., @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012; @pinciottiCallActionRecommendations2021; @murrayDissectingCoreFear2016].
In research, semi-structured interviews ensure consistency and accuracy, reducing ambiguity in identifying core threats and enhancing the reliability and validity of findings.
Moreover, these interviews allow for the assignment of probability and threat values to both proximal and core threats.
Tracking these values across treatment can provide valuable insights into therapeutic change and its relationship to other constructs.

### The Catastrophizing Interview

The catastrophizing interview is a well-established procedure for investigating catastrophizing in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and related disorders [@daveyCatastrophisingInterviewProcedure2006; @vaseyCatastrophizingAssessmentWorrisome1992].
Developed by Vasey and Borkovec [-@vaseyCatastrophizingAssessmentWorrisome1992], the procedure is based on the decatastrophizing technique used in cognitive therapy [@kendallFutureCognitiveAssessment1987].
The interview consists of two phases: topic generation and catastrophizing.
During topic generation, participants list their current worries, rate the percentage of time spent worrying about each topic, and evaluate its significance.
The topic with the highest percentage is then selected for the catastrophizing phase.
Participants are asked, "What is it about [selected worry topic] that worries you?" and then, "What about [participant's response] would you find fearful or bad if it did actually happen?" This questioning continues until participants either refuse to continue, cannot generate further responses, or repeat the same response three times.

The procedure was later refined to improve standardization [@daveyCatastrophisingInterviewProcedure2006].
Participants were instructed to write concise, single-sentence responses for each step on a response sheet.
Examples of typical catastrophizing steps were provided beforehand to familiarize participants with the process.
These updates reduced variability in responses and enhanced accessibility.
Initially designed for GAD, the procedure was later adapted for worry in insomnia [@harveyCatastrophicWorryPrimary2003] and rumination in depression [@watkinsMoodInputRumination2002].
It primarily assesses the tendency to perseverate in worry by quantifying the number of catastrophizing steps.

While effective for measuring perseverative worry, the catastrophizing interview is not designed to identify the underlying threat that triggers fear.
Investigating core threats requires a distinct approach focused on uncovering the ultimate fear driving anxiety.
To address these challenges, we developed a tailored interview specifically for identifying core threats.

### The Core Threat Structured Interview

The Core Threat Structured Interview (CTSI) begins by identifying a focal proximal threat^[The CTSI manual can be found in the supplementary materials.].
This involves identifying situations or stimuli that induce fear or are avoided, and any rituals or safety behaviors the individual engages in.
Once a set of fear responses is identified, participants select the situation that causes the most distress or negative impact on their life.

To identify core threats, the CTSI employs an adaptation of the classic "downward arrow" technique [e.g., @dugasCognitiveBehavioralTreatmentGeneralized2005].
Unlike the traditional focus on chains of beliefs [@beckCognitiveBehaviorTherapy2011], the CTSI emphasizes events, guiding participants through the question, "And then what would happen?" [@huppertCoreFearsValues2012].
Participants are first asked what they fear will happen if they refrain from avoidance or safety behaviors related to their chosen proximal threat.
Follow-up questions such as "And then what?", "What is so terrible about that?", and "What does that mean to you?" are used to explore progressively deeper fears [@beckCognitiveBehaviorTherapy2011; @leahyCognitiveTherapyTechniques2003].
Through this iterative process, the interview continues until the underlying core threat is identified.

Core threats consist of an *expectation* that an event could occur and an *evaluation* that the event would be catastrophic [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
These roughly translate to likelihood and cost [e.g., @foaEmotionalProcessingFear1986].
The evaluation depends on an individual’s unique values, goals, and motivations.
Therefore, it is helpful to ask not only what might happen but also what the event would *mean* to them or why it matters so much.
This approach often leads in surprising directions [i.e., a form of guided discovery\; @padeskySocraticQuestioningChanging1993].
For instance, one woman worried that her children were abusing drugs.
When asked what was so horrible about that, she explained it meant her children were not sharing everything with her, which in turn signified to her that she was failing as a mother.

In practice, the link between proximal and core threats often follows a chain of progressively more threatening outcomes.
For example, an individual might state, "If I don’t wash my hands, I will be contaminated, leading to illness, which will hinder my ability to function, and ultimately sabotage my career."
Another individual might say, "A burglar might break into my house, harm or kidnap my child, and I couldn’t bear that, as ensuring my family’s safety and growth is the most crucial part of my life."
In some cases, individuals describe multiple possible outcomes.
When this happens, they are encouraged to explore the branch they find most threatening.
The interview concludes when the participant cannot or will not identify a deeper threat, or when further questioning becomes repetitive.
Importantly, these branches are highly idiosyncratic, and generic pathways are insufficient.

At times, individuals may "overshoot" their core threat, describing their response to it instead of the threat itself.
For example, someone who fears their family dying in a car crash may upon further inquiry describe fear of falling into depression.
In such cases, the core threat is likely their family dying.
To clarify, the interviewer can explicitly compare the options: "What would be worse for you: having your family die or sinking into depression?"
However, there are instances where the response is indeed the feared outcome.
For example, an individual may fear becoming so disgusted or anxious that they can no longer function, care for their family, or maintain relationships.
These nuances highlight the importance of careful exploration to accurately identify the core threat.

### Getting at Deeper Motivations

Identifying core threats can be challenging, as simply asking what could happen is often insufficient.
Understanding the processes that create discrepancies between proximal and core threats can help address these difficulties.
Two key processes that interfere with identifying core threats are avoidance and difficulty accessing emotional cognitions.
These two issues will be explored in detail below.

One explanation for the difficulty to uncover core threats is avoidance.
Individuals may focus on immediate, proximal threats because confronting deeper, more global threats is distressing.
Encouraging individuals to endure this discomfort and approach their fears can often facilitate access to core threats.

Another explanation involves the nature of underlying threats, which are often evident only in emotional reasoning or "hot" cognitions.
These can be difficult to access in calmer, more reflective environments [see @safranElicitingHotCognitions1982; @davidCognitionsCognitivebehavioralPsychotherapies2006].
To address this, clinicians use techniques designed to tap into emotional reasoning.
In the CTSI, individuals are encouraged to focus on their *feelings* rather than their "cold" cognitive appraisals.
Asking, "What do you *feel* might happen?" instead of "What do you *think* might happen?" highlights the distinction between emotional and cognitive reasoning, helping to uncover hidden core threats.

Another technique involves the use of imagery, which research shows evokes stronger emotional responses than verbal processing alone [@holmesMentalImageryEmotion2005; @holmesMentalImageryEmotion2010].
By guiding individuals to imagine threatening scenarios vividly, clinicians can bring emotions and memories to the surface, providing better access to hot cognitions.
Together, these techniques offer complementary pathways for uncovering the deeper motivations behind anxiety-related behaviors.

## Hypotheses

The current study examines the phenomenology of core threats as measured by the CTSI.
We propose the following hypotheses:

1. Core threats differ significantly from proximal threats. 
    a. Core threats cannot be reliably predicted based on proximal threats.
    b. Core threats exhibit greater variability than proximal threats.
2. A single core threat often underlies and motivates multiple proximal threats.
3. Core threats remain stable over time, demonstrating consistency across repeated assessments.

By exploring the relationship between core and proximal threats and testing these hypotheses through the CTSI, this study aims to deepen our understanding of the fundamental processes that drive fear and anxiety disorders.
These insights may contribute to refining theoretical models and improving clinical interventions by emphasizing the role of core threats in shaping anxiety-related behaviors.

# Transparency and Openness

### Preregistration

The study was pre-registered on AsPredicted ([https://aspredicted.org/89j7-5m4t.pdf](https://aspredicted.org/89j7-5m4t.pdf)) after data collection was completed but before coding of threat types began.
The pre-registration included hypotheses, methods, data collection procedures, and analysis plans, ensuring that the analyses were planned without influence from the raw data.

Several deviations from the pre-registered plan occurred:

1. To increase reliability, we used three judges to categorize core threats instead of two. All judges coded the threats simultaneously, ensuring that the addition was not done to affect initial outcomes.
2. We were unable to apply information methods (Theil's U) to assess the agreement between sets of threats due to the complexity of the data structure. Instead, we used permutation tests, as described below to investigate the same hypotheses.
3. The third experimental group (high anxiety, online CTSI) was reported as two separate groups—Hebrew-speaking and English-speaking—due to demographic differences.

### Data, materials, code, and online resources
Supplementary materials, including datasets, analysis scripts, and detailed methodological documentation, are available on GitHub at [https://github.com/eladzlot/ctsi-2025-public](https://github.com/eladzlot/ctsi-2025-public).
To ensure participant confidentiality, the datasets have been redacted to include only quantitative information, as the core threats and other open-ended responses could potentially identify specific individuals.

### Reporting
We report how we determined all data exclusions, all manipulations, and all measures in the study.
This study involved an analysis of existing data rather than new data collection, thus we do not report how we determined the sample size for each study.

### Ethical approval
All studies were approved by the ethical review board of the The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

# Methods

## Design

This study comprised four experiments, each involving distinct samples of participants who completed the CTSI. 
Experiment 1 targeted individuals with obsessive-compulsive symptoms, who participated in face-to-face interviews conducted via Zoom.
Experiment 2 also employed Zoom interviews but focused on a transdiagnostic sample of individuals with high anxiety levels.
Experiment 3 introduced a digital, self-administered version of the CTSI, allowing participants to complete the interview independently online.
Experiment 4 replicated the methodology of Experiment 3 with an international, English-speaking sample.
Given that results are presented in a similar fashion for each experiment, and it is useful to the reader to be able to see the results comparatively across the four Experiments, we present the unique methods for each of the four experiments below, and following this, we present the results of all four experiments simultaneously.

## Measures

**Core Threat Structured Interview (CTSI):** The CTSI is a semi-structured interview developed to identify the core threats driving fear or anxiety in individuals with anxiety disorders.
It includes a series of questions aimed at uncovering the central trigger of fear or anxiety, followed by a guided process (using a "downward arrow" technique) to reveal the underlying core threat, and concludes with a section focused on clarifying the idiographic meaning of the threat for the individual.
The CTSI was administered face-to-face via Zoom in the first two samples, targeting individuals with OCD and transdiagnostic anxiety.
For the last two samples, a self-administered online version of the interview was used.
During Experiments 1 and 2, minor adjustments were made to refine the interview process; these adjustments did not alter the fundamental structure of the CTSI or its aims.
Both the face-to-face and online versions of the CTSI are available in the supplementary materials.

## Data Analysis

### Rating Threats

This study addresses the extent to which different descriptions of threats are similar.
Specifically, we examine whether proximal and core threats align and whether core threats remain consistent across time.
To systematically assess this similarity, threats were categorized, enabling structured analysis.

Our investigation is primarily focused on identifying the threats driving fear responses.
These threats are manifestations of the values motivating these responses [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
While several taxonomies of basic values exist [see @austinGoalConstructsPsychology1996; @ryanOxfordHandbookHuman2012 for reviews], none adequately cover the types of threats commonly associated with fear, including Schwartz's taxonomy [-@schwartzUniversalsContentStructure1992], previously suggested for organizing core threats [@huppertCoreFearsValues2012].
To fill this gap, we developed a novel taxonomy of global motivations based on clinical insights, expert consultations, and theoretical frameworks such as those advanced by Dweck [-@dweckNeedsGoalsRepresentations2017].
This taxonomy, detailed in Table \@ref(tab:values), was used to code both proximal and core threats.

Three trained research assistants applied this taxonomy to categorize threats.
Motivations underlying threats are often complex and may arise from multiple sources.
For example, fear of contamination might stem from both concerns about sickness leading to death and feelings of disgust.
Coders identified the primary motivation underlying each threat.
When two motivations were equally prominent, both were recorded.
If no clear dominant motivation emerged or the threat description lacked clarity, the threat was classified as ambiguous.
This approach accommodates variability in how threats are reported and interpreted.
Agreement between judges or across threats was defined as sharing at least one common motivation.
Detailed coding criteria and instructions are provided in the supplementary materials.

Coders were trained using external datasets not included in the current analyses.
Each judge independently coded the dataset, and discrepancies were resolved through consensus discussions.
This rigorous adjudication process ensured consistency in applying the taxonomy.

Table: (\#tab:values) The taxonomy of values used for coding threats.

| Category of Drives | Description                                                | Examples of Core Threats                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Affiliation       | The drive to form social or interpersonal bonds and avoid rejection.        | Rejection, social isolation, loneliness, being alone, social awkwardness. This covers anything from family connections to wide social acceptance |
| Predictability    | The drive to understand and make sense of one's environment. | Confusion, uncertainty, unpredictability.                     |
| Competence        | The drive for effectiveness, capability, and practical functioning.        | Failure, not knowing what to do, incompetence.                |
| Agency \& Control    | The drive to have agency and be in control of one's self and environment. | Losing control, doing something unintended, helplessness.
| Survival          | The goal of staying alive.                                 | Death of onself, or a close other (survival by proxy).
| Physical Comfort  | The goal of avoiding physical discomfort or suffering.     | Pain, injury, physical harm to self or close other (physical comfort by proxy)    |
| Self-Image        | The desire to maintain a positive self-image and avoid a negative one. | Feeling worthless, evil, or guilty. Feeling that I've let myself down. 
| Morality          | The drive to behave ethically and uphold virtues.          | Harming others, violating religious beliefs or morals. 
| Distress (in)tolerance | The desire to avoid psychological distress or discomfort. | Disgust, Not-just-right experiences, pure psychic pain. 

Krippendorff's $\alpha$ was selected as the statistical measure of inter-rater reliability due to its robustness and flexibility.
This measure is widely used to assess consistency among raters across various data types, including nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales [@hallgrenComputingInterRaterReliability2012; @hayesAnsweringCallStandard2007].
Its ability to accommodate more than two raters and handle missing data makes it particularly well-suited for our study, where raters categorized mixed data types.
Krippendorff's $\alpha$ values are interpreted as follows: values between 0.60 and 0.74 indicate moderate agreement, suitable for exploratory research; values between 0.75 and 0.84 reflect good agreement; and values of 0.85 or above signify excellent reliability, appropriate for measures requiring high precision or strong consensus.
These thresholds guided our interpretation of reliability within this study.
As pre-registered, ratings of "ambiguous" were treated as missing data in the computation of $\alpha$, as they do not represent a definitive decision about motivation.
This decision ensures that reliability estimates reflect only clear and specific categorizations.
Sensitivity analyses confirmed that this approach did not substantially affect the results.
Further details of the reliability scoring algorithm are provided in the supplementary materials.

### Agreement

This study examines the correlations between sets of threats, each consisting of one or two categories.
Traditional statistical measures, typically designed for single-category data, are insufficient to handle the complexity of multi-category sets, necessitating an alternative analytical approach.
To address this, we calculated the rate of agreement, defined as the percentage of pairs that share at least one category in common across all possible pairs.
This relatively liberal criterion accounts for the inherent fuzziness in defining drives and distinguishing between the primary and secondary motivations underlying anxiety.

While Theil's U was pre-registered as the information-theoretic measure to assess agreement, we encountered difficulties applying it due to the complex structure of our data.
As a result, we switched to permutation tests, a non-parametric approach well-suited to handling this complexity [@edgingtonRandomizationTests2007].
Unlike traditional methods, permutation tests make no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
By repeatedly shuffling the data, these tests generate a null distribution of the test statistic, enabling the computation of p-values based on the proportion of permutations yielding a statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed one [@ernstPermutationMethodsBasis2004].

This method is robust for small samples like ours and circumvents the limitations of standard analytical techniques, such as information-theoretic measures, which are ill-suited to our data.
We report the expected number of agreements, the empirical count of agreements, and the likelihood (p) of obtaining the empirical count by chance, assuming the expected count is accurate.
Consistent with conventional statistical practice, $p<.05$ is considered significant.

### Motivational Diversity

Hypothesis 1b posits that core threats are associated with diverse motivations, whereas proximal threats are not.
To quantify this diversity, we employ a variation of Simpson's Diversity Index [$D$\; @simpsonMeasurementDiversity1949].
$D$ measures "unalikeability," or the probability that two randomly selected members of a population will have different motivations [@kaderVariabilityCategoricalVariables2007].
It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a completely heterogeneous population and 1 indicates a maximally homogeneous population (all members share the same motivations).
For interpretability, we classify $D$ values below 0.2 as highly diverse, values between 0.2 and 0.4 as moderately diverse, and values above 0.4 as non diverse.

While the standard form of $D$ assumes discrete, mutually exclusive categories, our data allows for overlapping motivations.
For example, one threat might be driven by both affiliation and survival, while another is driven solely by affiliation.
To accommodate this, we adapted the calculation of $D$ to account for partial overlaps between motivations.
Specifically, we define $D = \frac{\sum \delta_{ij}}{N(N-1)}$, where: $N$ is the total number of threats, $\delta_{ij}$ is the agreement function, which returns 1 if the motivations of $i$ and $j$ overlap and 0 otherwise, $i \neq j$ ensures that a member is never compared to itself.

The diversity of a sample is considered greater than another if more than 95% of bootstrapped $D$ values for one sample exceed those of the other.
Bootstrapping is employed because it provides a robust, non-parametric method to assess variability and establish confidence intervals for $D$ values, making it ideal for our data's structure and sample size.
This approach allows us to directly test whether core threats exhibit significantly greater motivational diversity than proximal threats, supporting or refuting the hypothesis.
