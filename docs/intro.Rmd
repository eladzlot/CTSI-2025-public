Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. *Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina*

A patient walks into the clinic.
You can immediately see her careful demeanor and chafed hands.
She complains that she compulsively washes her hands, that she doesn't go to public restrooms, and that she is afraid of touching doorknobs without carefully cleaning them.
What is she afraid of?
When questioned, she says that she is afraid of being contaminated.
But is contamination the true threat underlying her fear?
Initial reports about a patient’s fears are often quite remote from their underlying fear [@borkovecWorryCognitivePhenomenon1998].
It may be that this patient is actually afraid of becoming sick and dying.
It is possible that she is worried that she will contaminate her children or family.
Alternatively, she may be anxious of becoming revolting or disgusting and being rejected by society.
Or she might be afraid of suffering.
The important thing is that we don't know until we ask.

These underlying concerns, known as core threats, are also referred to as core fears, catastrophic beliefs or central innately aversive outcomes.
They play a crucial role in treating anxiety disorders [@huppertCoreFearsValues2012; @zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
Many clinicians appreciate the importance of core threats and their role in the treatment of anxiety
[e.g.\, @craskeOptimizingExposureTherapy2022; @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012; @pinciottiCallActionRecommendations2021;@murrayDissectingCoreFear2016].
However, clinical guidelines for determining core threats are lacking.
The current paper aims to provide such guidelines, as well as investigate the phenomenology of core threats.

## What are Core Threats?

Fear and anxiety serve as adaptive responses to perceived threats.
The nature of threats within a given context typically follows a hierarchical pattern.
Consider a jungle, where the dangers might include venomous snakes, prowling lions, quicksand, or hidden traps.
In this context, the jungle itself is the proximal threat, serving as the immediate indicator of danger.
However, the core threat is death, the ultimate feared outcome underlying these dangers.
It is the plausibility of death that imbues the jungle with its threatening nature and evokes fear.

In practice, a core threat emerges from the intersection of expectation (the likelihood of death) and evaluation (the negative consequence of potential death).
Thus, the same situation may entail different core threats for different people.
Using the jungle scenario as an illustration underscores this variability.
Different people may fear different things when thinking of the jungle.
Expectations may differ, leading one person to fear encountering a snake, while another may dread encountering a jaguar.
Additionally, perceptions of risk may differ; for instance, one individual may consider a snake bite more threatening, perhaps due to its unexpected nature, while another may find a jaguar attack more distressing, possibly because of the perceived intensity of pain.
Moreover, even when evaluating the same event, individuals may prioritize different aspects.
For instance, given the threat of snakes, one person might emphasize their unpredictable nature, another their sliminess, while another may focus on the threat to their life, and yet another could be concerned about the well-being of their family in the event that they die.
Thus, the same outcome can hold distinct meanings for different people.

These distinctions are important when examining anxiety disorders [e.g., @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012; @pinciottiCallActionRecommendations2021; @murrayDissectingCoreFear2016].
In pathological anxiety, a seemingly harmless stimulus is perceived as dangerous.
To ascertain its safety, understanding the specific nature of the threat attributed to it becomes essential [@craskeOptimizingExposureTherapy2022; @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012; @murrayDissectingCoreFear2016; @huppertCoreFearsValues2012].
Consider an individual who is afraid of seeing blood— assuming that their core threat involves the stress of encountering blood-like stimuli, exposure involving sheep blood may be called for.
However, if their primary fear is related to contracting AIDS, they might not respond well to exposure to sheep blood.
The distinction holds in the same way for thought challenges or behavioral experiments.
Furthermore, a major challenge of safety learning is that it is difficult to generalize across contexts [see @boutonContextAmbiguityUnlearning2002].
Focusing on core threats highlights the threatening aspect of feared stimuli and thus promotes generalization of safety learning across contexts [@@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025; @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012].
Last but not least, identifying core threats enables clinicians to better understand patients' experiences when confronting their fears.
This, in turn, fosters a sense of being understood and supported for the patients, as well as giving them a coherent narrative for understanding their pathological behavior.
Thus, determining core threats might significantly influence the trajectory of psychotherapy.
This impact is evident from the initial stages of forming the case formulation [@personsCaseFormulationApproach2012] to the implementation of specific interventions like exposures, thought challenges, or behavioral experiments.

## Determining Core threats

Accurately identifying core threats is not trivial.
It requires a clear understanding of what core threats are, as well as the types of questions best used to determine them.
Therefore, a semi-structured interview is useful for identifying them [@samuelSurveyInterviewMethods2020].
It may serve as a valuable tool for both clinical and research applications.
In clinical settings, it enables therapists to discern the specific motivations driving anxiety-related behaviors, facilitating the development of a clear case forumulation [@personsCaseFormulationApproach2012] as well as personally tailored interventions [e.g., @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012; @pinciottiCallActionRecommendations2021; @murrayDissectingCoreFear2016].
In research, the semi-structured interview ensures consistency and accuracy, preventing ambiguous identification of core threats, thereby enhancing the reliability and validity of findings.

### The Catastrophising Interview

A well-established procedure exists for investigating catastrophizing in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and related disorders [@daveyCatastrophisingInterviewProcedure2006; @vaseyCatastrophizingAssessmentWorrisome1992].
Vasey and Borkovec [-@vaseyCatastrophizingAssessmentWorrisome1992] devised the catastrophising interview procedure based on cognitive therapy's decatastrophising technique [@kendallFutureCognitiveAssessment1987].
The procedure consists of two phases: topic generation and catastrophizing.
During the topic generation phase, participants list their current worries and rate the percentage of time spent worrying about each topic and its significance.
The topic with the highest percentage is selected for the catastrophizing interview.
The interview starts with the question, "What is it about [selected worry topic] that worries you?".
Followed by the question, "What about [participant's response to the previous question] would you find fearful or bad if it did actually happen?".
This sequence continues until participants refuse to continue the interview, are unable to generate further responses, or repeat the same general response three consecutive times.

The procedure was later updated for improved response standardization [@daveyCatastrophisingInterviewProcedure2006].
Participants were guided to write their responses for each catastrophising step on a response sheet, limiting each response to a single sentence space.
This facilitated concise and accessible records, avoiding overly elaborate answers spanning multiple steps.
Additionally, before starting the procedure, all participants received examples of initial steps in a typical catastrophising sequence, familiarizing them with the procedure's requirements.
The catastrophizing interview, initially designed for GAD, was later extended to other related disorders, such as worry in insomnia [@harveyCatastrophicWorryPrimary2003] and rumination in depression [@watkinsMoodInputRumination2002].
It primarily examines the tendency to perseverate in worry by quantifying the number of catastrophizing steps.
In contrast, the goal when investigating core threats is to identify the underlying threat that triggers fear.
As a result, we have developed an interview specifically tailored to address the distinct challenges associated with identifying core threats.

### The Core Threat Structured Interview

The Core Threat Structured Interview (CTSI) starts by identifying a focal proximal threat
^[The CTSI manual can be found in the supplementary materials ].
This involves inquiring about fear-inducing stimuli or situations, as well as situations or stimuli that individuals tend to avoid, along with any rituals or safety behaviors they engage in.
Once a set of fear responses is identified, participants are asked to select the situation that causes the most distress or negative effects in their life.

The CTSI approaches the identification of core threats by applying the classic "downward arrow" technique [e.g., @dugasCognitiveBehavioralTreatmentGeneralized2005].
However, in contrast with the classical downward arrow that focuses a chain of beliefs [@beckCognitiveBehaviorTherapy2011],
identifying core threats is often characterized by a focus on events: "and then what would happen?" [@huppertCoreFearsValues2012].
Considering the proximal threat that they have chosen, participants are asked what they fear will happen if they do not engage in any avoidance or safety behaviors.
Subsequently, a series of follow-up questions are asked, such as "and then what," "what is so terrible about that," and "what does that mean to you" [@beckCognitiveBehaviorTherapy2011; @leahyCognitiveTherapyTechniques2003].
As the interview proceeds, the questions are used to refer to deeper and deeper threats until the core threat is identified.

Core threats are comprised from an *expectation* that an event could happen, and of the *evaluation* that this event is catastrophic [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
The evaluation of an event as catastrophic depends on one's idiographic set of values, goals, and motivations.
Therefore, it is helpful to ask individuals not only what can happen, but also what would the threat happening mean to them or what it is about the threat that makes them care so much.
This line of questioning leads at times in surprising directions [i.e., a form of guided discovery\; @padeskySocraticQuestioningChanging1993].
One woman was worried that her children were abusing drugs.
When asked what was so horrible about that for her, she replied that
it meant that her children were not sharing everything with her and that meant that she was a failure as a mother.

In practice, the link between proximal and core threats often follows a chain of progressively more threatening threats.
For example: "If I don't wash my hands, then I will be contaminated, leading to illness, which will hinder my ability to function, and that would be terrible as it could permanently sabotage my career."
Another example is: "A burglar might break into my house, find one of my children, and cause harm or potentially kidnap them, and I couldn't bear that, as ensuring the safety and growth of my family is the most crucial aspect of my life."
In certain instances, individuals describe multiple possible outcomes.
In such cases, they are encouraged to explore the branch that appears most threatening to them.
The interview concludes when the participant cannot or will not produce a deeper threat or when inquiring about further threats becomes repetitive.
It is important to note that these branches are very idiosyncratic to the individual and we do not think generic paths are sufficient. 

At times, when asked about further outcomes of their fear, individuals will "overshoot" their core threat.
This sometimes happens when instead of describing their core threat they describe their response to it.
For example, it is likely that if an individual first describes fear of their family dying in a car crash, and upon further inquiry describes fear of sinking into depression, that their core threat is of their family dying.
The way to investigate this possibility is by explicitly asking for a comparison: "What would be worse for you: having your family die, or sinking into depression?".
At other times, the response is indeed the feared outcome- for example feeling so disgusted or anxious that one could not function and work (or take care of their family or be in a relationship, etc.). 

### Getting at Deeper Motivations

People often have difficulty identifying their core threats, and simply asking what could happen is often insufficient.
Understanding the processes underlying the discrepancy between proximal threats and core threats may aid in assisting such individuals.
Two main processes that interfere with identification of core threats are avoidance and trouble in accessing emotional cognitions.

One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that it happens due to avoidance. 
Individuals may find it easier to focus on local, proximal threats rather than confront deeper, more global threats.
Thus, encouragement to endure the distress often helps with approach.

Another explanation is that the underlying threats are characteristic of emotional thinking or hot cognitions, making them difficult to access in a calmer environment [see @safranElicitingHotCognitions1982; @davidCognitionsCognitivebehavioralPsychotherapies2006].
To address this issue and access core threats, clinicians have developed techniques to facilitate introspection.
In the CTSI, individuals are asked to attend to their *feelings* of what might happen rather than their "cold" cognitions.
Emotional reasoning is often quite distinct from cognitive reasoning, and it is helpful to directly address this distinction by asking, "What do you *feel* might happen?" instead of "What do you *think* might happen?".
By focusing on emotions rather than thoughts, it may be possible to access core threats that would otherwise remain hidden or elusive.
Another technique used to access emotional reasoning is the application of imagery.
Research shows that images can evoke a more powerful emotional response compared to verbal processing alone [@holmesMentalImageryEmotion2005; @holmesMentalImageryEmotion2010].
By asking individuals to imagine threatening scenarios, it is possible to bring memories to life and gain better access to hot cognitions.

## Hypotheses

The current study investigates the phenomenology of core threats as measured by the CTSI.
We posit the following main hypothesis:

1. Core threats are different from proximal threats. 
    a. Core threats cannot be predicted from proximal threats.
    b. Core threats demonstrate greater diversity in content than proximal threats.
2. One core threats often motivates multiple proximal threats.
3. Core threats are stable over time.

By exploring the relationship between core and proximal threats, and testing our hypotheses using the CTSI, we gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes underlying fear and anxiety disorders.

# Methods

Supplementary materials, including datasets, analysis scripts, and detailed methodological documentation, are available on GitHub at [https://github.com/eladzlot/ctsi-2025-public](https://github.com/eladzlot/ctsi-2025-public).
To protect participant confidentiality, the datasets have been redacted to include only quantitative information, as the core threats and other open-ended responses could potentially identify specific individuals.
These resources enhance transparency and facilitate replication of the findings.

## Design

This study encompasses four experiments, each involving different samples of individuals who completed the CTSI.
Experiment 1 focused on a sample of individuals with obsessive-compulsive symptoms, who completed the interview face-to-face via Zoom.
Experiment 2 also used Zoom for interviews but targeted a trans-diagnostic sample of highly anxious individuals.
Experiment 3 differed by employing a digital version of the interview, which participants completed themselves online.
Experiment 4 replicates experiment 3 in an international English speaking sample.
Given that results are presented in a similar fashion for each experiment, and it is useful to the reader to be able to see the results comparatively across the four Experiments, we present the unique methods for each of the four experiments below, and following this, we present the results of all four experiments simultaneously.

## Measures

**Core Threat Structured Interview (CTSI):** The CTSI is a newly developed semi-structured interview that is the focus of the current paper.
It was designed to identify the core threats underlying fear or anxiety in individuals suffering from anxiety disorders.
The CTSI consists of a series of questions that are aimed at identifying the most central trigger of fear or anxiety, followed by a downwards arrow to uncover the underlying core threat, and a final section focused on clarifying the idiographic meaning of the threat for the individual.
In the first two samples, the face-to-face interview was used to administer the CTSI for individuals with OCD and transdiagnostic anxiety, while a self-administered online version was used for the last two samples.
During experiment 1 and 2 minor changes were still being made to the interview, aimed at fine-tuning the interview process.
Both versions (face-to-face and online) are available in the supplementary materials.

## Data Analysis

### Rating Threats

A central question that this paper attempts to address is the similarity between different descriptions of threats.
For example, are proximal and core threats similar? Are core threats assessed at different times similar?
To assess the level of similarity or agreement between threats, they need to be categorized.
Categorization allows for a systematic and structured analysis.

Our investigation is primarily focused on identifying the threats driving fear responses.
These threats are manifestations of the values motivating these responses [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
Many taxonomies have been suggested for basic values [see @austinGoalConstructsPsychology1996; @ryanOxfordHandbookHuman2012 for reviews].
However, none seemed suitable for covering the types of threats commonly underlying fear, including Schwartz's taxonomy [-@schwartzUniversalsContentStructure1992], which has been suggested as a candidate for organizing core threats [@huppertCoreFearsValues2012].
To address this gap, we developed a new taxonomy of global motivations derived from clinical insights, consultations with experts, and established theories, particularly those highlighted by Dweck [-@dweckNeedsGoalsRepresentations2017].
This taxonomy, detailed in Table \@ref(tab:values), was used to code both core and proximal threats.

Three research assistants were trained to apply this taxonomy.
Motivations underlying threats are complex and may arise from multiple sources.
For instance, an individual might avoid contamination both to prevent sickness leading to death *and* because of disgust.
This study aims to identify the central motivation underlying each fear.
When two motivations appeared equally prominent, both were recorded.
However, if more than two motivations were equally strong without a clear dominant one, or if the threat was not clear, the motivation was classified as ambiguous.
This coding approach accommodates variability in the reporting of threats and in the interpretations by different judges.
Consistent with this methodology, agreement among judges or across different threats was defined as sharing at least one common motivation.
Detailed coding instructions and criteria can be found in the supplementary materials.

Training for coding was conducted using external data not included in the current analyses.
Each judge coded a whole data set on their own, consequently a consensus rating was achieved by adjudicating discrepancies.
In cases of disagreement, consensus was achieved through discussion.

Table: (\#tab:values) The taxonomy of values used for coding threats.

| Category of Drives | Description                                                | Examples of Core Threats                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

Given the diverse data types involved, Krippendorff's $\alpha$ was chosen as the statistical measure of inter-rater reliability.
Krippendorff's $\alpha$ is a robust statistical measure of inter-rater reliability, widely used to evaluate consistency among raters across various data types, including nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales [@hallgrenComputingInterRaterReliability2012; @hayesAnsweringCallStandard2007].
Additionally it naturally supports more than two raters, as well as missing data.
This flexibility makes it ideal for our study, where raters assign mixed data types.
Krippendorff's alpha values between 0.60 and 0.74 are considered moderate, indicating adequate agreement for exploratory research.
Values between 0.75 and 0.84 are considered good, while values of 0.85 and above reflect excellent reliability, suitable for measures requiring strong consensus or precision.
When computing inter-rater reliability we treated ratings of "ambiguous" as missing data because they do not represent a specific decision regarding motivation
^[We performed sensitivity analyses to ensure that this decision did not majorly affect results].
Full details of the reliability scoring algorithm employed are available in the supplementary materials.

### Agreement

Our study explores the correlations between sets of threats, where each member comprises one or two categories.
Traditional statistical measures, typically designed to handle single-category data sets, are insufficient for our multi-category approach, prompting the need for an alternative analytical approach.
To evaluate the concordance between these sets, we calculated the rate of agreement, specifically defined as the percentage of pairs that share at least one category in common among all possible pairs.
While this criterion is relatively liberal, it is appropriate given the inherent fuzziness in defining categories of drives and distinguishing between the primary and secondary drives of anxiety.

To assess whether the observed agreements exceeded those expected by chance, we employed permutation tests.
These non-parametric tests are ideal for our analysis because they do not assume specific underlying data distribution, an essential consideration given our complex data structure [@edgingtonRandomizationTests2007].
Permutation tests shuffle the data repeatedly to generate a distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis, thereby allowing us to compute p-values based on the proportion of reshuffled data sets that yield a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed one [@ernstPermutationMethodsBasis2004].
This method is robust for small samples such as ours and is particularly useful given that the nature of our data precludes the use of standard analytical techniques, such as information theoretic measures.
We report the expected number of agreements, the empirical count of agreements, and the likelihood (p) of obtaining the empirical count by chance, assuming the expected count is correct.
Here, p is interpreted as a traditional p-value, and $p<.05$ is considered significant.

### Motivational Diversity

Hypothesis 1b posits that core threats are associated with diverse motivations, whereas proximal threats are not.
To examine the dispersion of motivations, we employ a variation of Simpson's Diversity Index ($D$) [@simpsonMeasurementDiversity1949].
This index quantifies "unalikeability," or the probability that randomly paired members of the population will have different motivations [@kaderVariabilityCategoricalVariables2007].
$D$ ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a completely heterogeneous population and 1 indicates a maximally homogeneous population (all members share the same motivations).
For interpretability, we classify $D$ values below 0.2 as highly diverse, values between 0.2 and 0.4 as moderately diverse, and values above 0.4 as non diverse.

The standard form of $D$ is symmetrical, assuming that each "species" matches only itself.
It is defined as $D = \sum \left(\frac{n_i(n_i-1)}{N(N-1)}\right)$, where $n_i$ represents the count of individuals with a specific motivation, and $N$ is the total number of individuals.
Given our definition of fit, an individual's motivation can correspond with a non-identical motivation (e.g., if one threat is motivated by affiliation and another by both affiliation and survival).
To compute the $D$ index in this context, we count the number of possible agreements between pairs and divide them by the number of possible agreements $N(N-1)$.
Thus, $D = \frac{\sum \delta_{ij}}{N(N-1)}$, where $\delta$ is the agreement function that returns 1 if the motivations of $i$ and $j$ agree and 0 if they do not, and where $i$ never equals $j$ (a member can never meet itself).
The diversity of one sample is considered greater than another if more than $95\%$ of bootstrapped $D$ values are greater.
