# Discussion

The current study aimed to provide clinical guidelines for identifying core threats in anxiety disorders and to explore the phenomenology of these threats.
Core threats, the underlying fears driving proximal threats, play a crucial role in the structure and treatment of anxiety disorders [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
While proximal threats may involve immediate fears such as contamination or injury, core threats often reflect deeper concerns, including death, social rejection, or moral failure.
Despite their frequent application in clinical practice (commonly referred to as core fears), core threats have not been systematically studied.

Our first hypothesis addressed the discrepancy between core and proximal threats.
Previous research [@huppertCoreFearsValues2012; @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012; @murrayExtinctionTheoryAnorexia2016] has underscored the complexity of core threats and highlighted the importance of clinicians delving deeper into patients' fears.
Consistent with these findings, we observed that proximal threats were generally distinct from their associated core threats.
Notably, only about one-third of proximal threats in the transdiagnostic samples predicted their corresponding core threats.
This suggests that identifying core threats remains a meaningful endeavor, to ensure reliable identification of core threats in the remaining two-thirds.
This distinction appears especially critical in OCD, where core threats are more diverse and proximal threats less predictive.

Contrary to our expectations, significant differences in the diversity of core versus proximal threats were observed only in the OCD sample (after applying the Holm-Bonferroni correction), and these effects were modest.
Shifting focus to the content of core threats, we observed that, across all four samples, core threats tended to concentrate on themes such as affiliation, self-image, competence, and control.
In contrast, proximal threats were often more ambiguous or focused on distress tolerance.


## Assessing Validity

The development of the CTSI was driven by practical research and clinical needs.
Despite their theoretical foundation and frequent use in clinical practice, core threats lacked a validated tool for systematic measurement in research or therapy.
The CTSI was created by integrating common clinical practices with insights from the catastrophizing interview [@daveyCatastrophisingInterviewProcedure2006].
Early versions of the interview were manualized and refined based on expert feedback.

The current study aimed to evaluate the CTSI's validity and reliability as a tool for identifying core threats.
Face validity was established through expert clinician reviews, confirming that identified core threats aligned with those commonly observed in psychotherapy.
Construct validity was demonstrated through evidence of both convergent and divergent validity.
Participants consistently reported that their identified core threats reflected their motivations, demonstrating convergent validity.
Meanwhile, the mild associations between core and proximal threats supported divergent validity.
Furthermore, participants indicated that core threats captured their motivations better than proximal threats, highlighting their distinctiveness.

In terms of reliability, the CTSI demonstrated robust test-retest reliability, ensuring consistent identification of core threats across administrations.
It also exhibited good inter-rater reliability, with different clinicians reaching consistent conclusions.
Finally, the findings showed consistency across diverse samples, reinforcing the CTSI's applicability and relevance to various populations.

## What are We Measuring?

A major question remains whether fear is indeed organized, to a certain extent, around core threats.
This challenge has two key dimensions: theoretical and functional.

The theoretical challenge involves determining whether core threats are genuinely part of the fear structure and understanding the process by which the CTSI identifies them.
It is uncertain whether individuals possess direct verbal access to their underlying motivations.
Even if they do, questions arise about how clinicians or researchers can reliably identify these motivations.
From this perspective, core threats could be difficult to access or may not exist in the way we conceptualize them.
For instance, core threats might be generated through random processes or influenced by non-anxiety-related factors (e.g., "what would sound valuable or important to me").
Alternatively, the observed reliability over time and across interviewers could reflect participants recalling previous responses rather than genuine consistency.

We have reviewed the theoretical arguments for the existence of core threats elsewhere [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
Briefly, we propose that core threats exist in all individuals, and that the evaluations of their probability and of their meaning potentially contributing to pathological anxiety.
While not all individuals possess pathological core threats, identifying such threats in those who do can support case conceptualization and enhance the generalization of learning in psychotherapy.

Even assuming that a core threat can be determined, an interesting question arises: Is the core threat identified or construed?
Is the process of determining a core threat akin to uncovering an existing prototype [cf. @roschCognitionCategorization1978]?
Or should core threats be treated as ad-hoc narratives, individually tailored to activate the fear structure [cf. @barsalouAbstractionPerceptualSymbol2003]?
If the latter is the case, the therapist’s role would be to help the patient construe a core threat that effectively activates the fear network as opposed to determining it.

Ultimately, these challenges may be unresolvable.
There will always be alternative explanations, as we lack direct access to these theoretical constructs [see @dehouwerWhyCognitiveApproach2011].
One might ask, "If we can't be sure we can access core threats, are they scientific?"
We argue that many useful and theoretically interesting constructs are similarly inaccessible, yet remain valuable, such as attachment styles, cognitive schemas, or implicit biases.
Indirect methods, such as physiological measures of anxiety and implicit measures [@gawronskiImplicitMeasuresSocial2014], may provide access.
The accumulating data, particularly the functional implications of core threats, increasingly support the validity of this cognitive construct.

The functional challenge is as follows: Are we indeed identifying the true core threats?
How can one validate this abstract clinical construct?
One approach is to define a functional definition of core threats that *can* be empirically examined [@dehouwerWhyCognitiveApproach2011].
Core threats primarily represent an individual’s motivations to avoid certain stimuli or situations.
Indeed, preliminary findings suggested this is accurate; many individuals reported that their identified core threat indeed reflected their true motivation.
However a more concrete functional definition is needed.

Furthermore, a significant critique of the CTSI is its potential circularity.
By defining proximal threats as distinct from core threats, participants are implicitly guided to identify a different underlying threat.
Consequently, it is unsurprising that proximal threats differ from core threats.
This issue is especially pronounced in cases involving distress-tolerance-related core threats, which are rare among core threats but common among proximal threats.
Additionally, requiring participants to articulate potential harm—even when they initially report none—may inadvertently prompt them to identify an alternative core threat.

The solution for both of these problems would lie in demonstrating that core threats, as identified through the CTSI, exhibit distinct behavioral patterns compared to proximal threats.
Core threats are believed to be more effective targets for safety learning, such as through exposure or behavioral experiments [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
Thus, demonstrating that focusing on core threats improves therapeutic outcomes would provide strong evidence for their validity.

## Distress Tolerance

Recent literature emphasizes distress tolerance as a central mechanism in anxiety disorders [@keoughAnxietySymptomatologyAssociation2010; @barlowUnifiedProtocolTransdiagnostic2010; @hayesAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy2006].
Literature on OCD highlights the importance of "not just right" experiences, sensory phenomena, incompleteness, and other seemingly harmless phenomena [e.g.\, @ferraoSensoryPhenomenaAssociated2012; @eckerIncompletenessHarmAvoidance2008].
An association between these phenomena and other anxiety disorders has also been found [@michelEmotionalDistressTolerance2016].
Indeed, distress tolerance has been shown to correlate with psychopathology [@leyroDistressTolerancePsychopathological2010] and has been suggested as a treatment target in various contexts, such as smoking cessation [@brownUncertaintyAnxietyAvoidance2022] and borderline personality disorder [@linehanCognitivebehavioralTreatmentBorderline1993].

Distress tolerance has been proposed as a primary transdiagnostic process to target in emotional disorders [@barlowUnifiedProtocolTransdiagnostic2010].
Building on this model, we emphasize harm avoidance as a complementary mechanism that warrants equal consideration.
Findings from our face-to-face experiments, involving both OCD and transdiagnostic samples, revealed a high prevalence of distress tolerance-related proximal threats and a low prevalence of distress tolerance-related core threats.
This pattern suggests that, even when distress tolerance is evident, harm avoidance likely plays a significant role in anxiety.
Indeed, recent findings indicate that at least part of the motivation underlying NJRE in OCD is due to interference with cognitive processes rather than enjoyment of daily life [@melliAssessingBeliefsConsequences2020].
In other words, beyond the challenge of tolerating distress, there remains the issue of disconfirming underlying threats that maintain anxiety [@craskeOptimizingExposureTherapy2022].

When designing transdiagnostic interventions, it is essential to address multiple underlying processes [@hofmannFutureInterventionScience2019].
While distress tolerance has received considerable attention, we argue that harm avoidance—particularly in the context of core threats—should also be considered a critical addition [@steimerBiologyFearAnxietyrelated2002; @foaEmotionalProcessingFear1986; @beckCognitiveTherapyCurrent2011].

## Core Threats in OCD

Much of the foundational work on core threats originates in the OCD literature [@huppertCoreFearsValues2012; @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012].
It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that core threats hold particular significance for individuals with OCD.
Our findings support this hypothesis and reveal notable differences between the OCD sample and the transdiagnostic samples.
In the OCD sample, proximal threats did not predict core threats at all, a pattern not observed in the transdiagnostic groups.
Additionally, core threats in the OCD sample were significantly more diverse than proximal threats, underscoring their heterogeneity.
There was also a disproportionate prevalence of distress tolerance-related proximal threats in the OCD sample, but this pattern did not extend to core threats.
These results emphasize the critical importance of identifying and addressing core threats for individuals suffering from OCD.

The observed differences between the OCD and transdiagnostic samples may stem from the inherent diversity of OCD presentations, which manifest in various forms.
Alternatively, this distinction may reflect the fact that the OCD sample was the only validated pathological group in our study.
Future research should investigate these differences further, focusing on how core and proximal threats interact across different anxiety disorders and how these relationships may inform tailored intervention strategies.

## Limitations and Further Research

Core threats have been theorized to play a central role in the generalization of threat [see @zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
If this is indeed the case, we would expect the same core threats to motivate multiple different proximal threats.
In the current study, we found some non-significant initial evidence that one core threat can underlie multiple proximal threats.
If this finding is confirmed with further research, it would suggest that safety learning targeting core threats could be a more effective intervention for anxiety disorders.
This notion would be strengthened further by demonstrating better generalization for core threat-focused learning [see @pinciottiCallActionRecommendations2021; @murrayExtinctionTheoryAnorexia2016].
However, the current dataset is too small to reach definitive conclusions, and further study with a larger sample size is needed.

To investigate the agreement between threats, we needed to codify them.
As no existing typology fully suited our needs, we developed one specifically for this study.
While this typology has not yet been validated, and there is a possibility of over-dividing certain categories (e.g., safety and physical discomfort) or under-dividing others (e.g., affiliation), we believe it is sufficient for exploring the associations between different threats.
Nonetheless, further psychometric work is needed to establish a robust and validated typology for core threats.

The CTSI attempts to identify the ultimate underlying threat, but it is not clear if it succeeds.
The stopping criteria used in the CTSI are accepted in the field [see @daveyCatastrophisingInterviewProcedure2006].
However, there is no guarantee that the true motivation is identified.
For example, should one stop at "I will die," or ask further to discover that the fear is of burning in hell?
And is burning in hell the correct stopping point, or should one delve deeper?
The instructions in the CTSI are to stop once the patient can no longer find any deeper meaning, repeat themselves, or once they start getting further from the underlying threat, as evidenced by lower levels of distress.
Ultimately, this question remains open and subjective to the discretion of the interviewer.
We argue that, despite the inherent noise in the process, the answers obtained are at least better than plain proximal threats, even if they do not reach the "true" core threat.

We know from several studies that core threats are deceptively diverse [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
For instance, Greenberg and colleagues [-@greenbergEgocentricAllocentricFears2018] examined whether the underlying fear in olfactory reference syndrome centers on embarrassing oneself or offending others.
They found that individuals possess both types of motivations, regardless of their cultural background (Western vs. Eastern).
Moreover, about a quarter of participants reported a completely unexpected concern: whether the odor indicated a medical condition.
This highlights the importance of investigating idiosyncratic fears expressed by individuals, beyond the stereotypical fears associated with specific disorders.
However, we hypothesize that different disorders exhibit distinct patterns of core threats.
For example, safety is a prominent concern in panic disorder and OCD but appears less central in social anxiety disorder, where competence and affiliation often take precedence.
Similarly, morality plays a significant role in OCD but is less pronounced in other disorders.
Thus, variability in core threats reflects both systematic, disorder-specific tendencies and individual idiosyncrasies.
Future research should focus on mapping these associations more comprehensively.

An additional limitation of this study is the low prevalence of predictability core threats.
Our clinical experience indicates that such core threats should be more prevalent (though not quite as prevalent as other motivators).
It is likely that the focus of the CTSI on specific harm-avoidance type outcomes may have masked such core threats.
For example, some people that fear having cancer are particularly bothered by the inherent fuzziness of the situation - that they can never know for sure.
When asked what they fear, they would focus on the cancer, but that is in fact over-shooting the actual motivating core threat.
To address this problem we recommend that interviewers review the downward arrow and explicitly ask what the worst outcome would be.

## Implications for Clinical Practice and Future Research

The findings of this study have implications for both clinical practice and future research.
Clinically, the Core Threat Structured Interview (CTSI) proves to be a valuable tool in uncovering the underlying fears that drive anxiety disorders, facilitating the development of more effective, tailored treatment plans.
This aligns with the work of Persons [@personsCaseFormulationApproach2012], who emphasized the importance of individualized case formulations in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

For future research, these findings open new avenues for exploring the mechanisms underlying the stability of core threats and their impact on treatment outcomes.
The fact that the CTSI includes a self-administered, online version that appears to be reliable and valid should allow significant further research.
We contend that one major limiting factor of studying core threats to date has been the absence of such a tool.
Investigating the interaction between core threats and other psychological constructs, such as resilience and coping strategies, could further enhance our understanding of anxiety disorders and inform more comprehensive treatment approaches.

In conclusion, this study underscores the potential critical role of core threats in anxiety disorders and provides a valid and reliable structured approach to identifying and addressing these threats in clinical practice.
By focusing on the underlying fears that drive surface threats, clinicians might be able to develop more effective interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
