# Discussion

The current study aimed to provide clinical guidelines for identifying core threats in anxiety disorders and to investigate the phenomenology of these threats.
Core threats, which are the underlying fears driving proximal threats, play a crucial role in anxiety disorders and their treatment [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
While proximal threats may involve immediate fears like contamination or injury, core threats often relate to deeper concerns such as death, social rejection, or moral failure.
Despite their common application in clinical practice (more often called core fears), core threats have not been formally studied.

The first hypothesis involved the discrepancy between core and proximal threats.
Previous research [@huppertCoreFearsValues2012;@gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012;@murrayExtinctionTheoryAnorexia2016] has highlighted the multifaceted nature of core threats, emphasizing the need for clinicians to delve deeper into patients' fears.
As expected, we found that proximal threats were quite distinct from their associated core threats.
However, proximal threats are not entirely removed from core threats—about a third of proximal threats in the transdiagnostic samples predicted their core threats.
We suggest that it remains meaningful and impactful to do the extra work to identify the underlying core threats for the remaining two-thirds.
It seems that identifying core threats are particularly important in OCD, where core threats are both more diverse, and proximal threats less predictive.

In contrast to our expectations, core threats were significantly more diverse than proximal threats only in the OCD sample (after Holm-Bonferonni correction).
Even then, the effects were not very large.
However, the content of threats tended to differ.
Core threats seemed to be more concentrated in affiliation, self-image, competence, and control.
Proximal threats were largely ambiguous or focused on distress tolerance.


## Assessing Validity

The development of the Core Threat Structured Interview (CTSI) emerged from practical research and clinical needs.
Although core threats are frequently utilized in clinical practice and have a solid theoretical foundation, there is currently no validated clinical tool available to measure them for research or clinical purposes.
The CTSI was developed by integrating common clinical practices with insights from the catastrophizing interview [@daveyCatastrophisingInterviewProcedure2006].
The process was manualized by implementing early versions of the interview and refining the instructions based on expert feedback.

The current study aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of the CTSI as a tool for identifying core threats.
To ensure face validity, expert clinicians reviewed the identified core threats and confirmed that they aligned with those typically recognized in psychotherapy.
Construct validity was supported by evidence of both convergent and divergent validity:
participants consistently reported that their identified core threats reflected their motivations, demonstrating convergent validity,
while core threats were only mildly associated with proximal threats, supporting divergent validity.
Additionally, participants indicated that core threats represented their motivations better than proximal threats, further emphasizing their distinctiveness.
In terms of reliability, the CTSI demonstrated robust test-retest reliability, ensuring consistent identification of core threats across administrations, and good inter-rater reliability, showing that different clinicians reached consistent conclusions.
Finally, the findings demonstrated consistency across diverse samples, reinforcing the CTSI's applicability and relevance across different populations.

A major question remains whether fear is indeed organized to a certain extent around core threats.
This challenge has two variations: functional and theoretical.

The theoretical challenge lies in understanding whether core threats are indeed part of the fear structure and in determining the process in which the CTSI identifies them.
It is unclear whether individuals have direct verbal access to their underlying motivations, and even if they do, how clinicians or researchers can accurately identify them.
From these perspectives, core threats may be inaccessible or nonexistent, rendering our data meaningless.
It is possible that core threats are generated by subjects through random processes or by considering non-anxiety-related factors (such as "what would sound valuable or important to me").
The observed reliability over time and across interviewers could simply be due to subjects recalling their previous responses.
We have reviewed the theoretical arguments for the existence of core threats elsewhere [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
Briefly, we suggest that core threats exist in all individuals, and that the evaluations of their probability and of their meaning is what can lead to pathological anxiety.
We do not contend that all individuals have pathological core threats, but rather that many do, and that identifying them can help with case conceptualization as well as generalization of learning that happens via therapy.

Furthermore, even assuming that a core threat can be determined, an interesting question arises: Is the core threat identified or construed?
Is the process of determining a core threat akin to uncovering an existing prototype [cf. @roschCognitionCategorization1978]?
Or should core threats be treated as ad-hoc narratives, individually tailored to activate the fear structure [cf. @barsalouAbstractionPerceptualSymbol2003]?
If the latter is the case, the therapist’s role would be to help the patient construe a core threat that effectively activates the fear network as opposed to determining it.

Ultimately, these challenges may be unresolvable.
There will always be alternative explanations, as we lack direct access to these theoretical constructs.
One might ask, "If we can't be sure we can access core threats, are they scientific?"
We argue that many useful and theoretically interesting constructs are similarly inaccessible, yet remain valuable, such as attachment styles, cognitive schemas, or implicit biases.
Indirect methods, such as physiological measures of anxiety and implicit measures [see @gawronskiImplicitMeasuresSocial2014], may provide access.
The accumulating data, particularly the functional implications of core threats, increasingly support the validity of this cognitive construct.

The functional challenge is as follows:
Are we indeed identifying the true core threats?
How can one validate this abstract clinical construct?
One approach is to define a functional definition of core threats that *can* be empirically examined [@dehouwerWhyCognitiveApproach2011].
Core threats primarily represent an individual’s motivations to avoid certain stimuli or situations.
Preliminary findings suggest this is accurate; many individuals reported that their identified core threat indeed reflected their true motivation.
Additionally, core threats are believed to be more effective targets for safety learning, such as through exposure or behavioral experiments [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
Demonstrating that focusing on core threats improves therapeutic outcomes would provide strong evidence for their validity.
Specifically, comparing the efficacy of therapy focusing on core versus proximal threats could functionally validate core threats.
## Distress Tolerance

Recent literature emphasizes distress tolerance as a central mechanism in anxiety disorders [@keoughAnxietySymptomatologyAssociation2010; @barlowUnifiedProtocolTransdiagnostic2010; @hayesAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy2006].
Literature on OCD highlights the importance of "not just right" experiences, sensory phenomena, incompleteness, and other seemingly harmless phenomena [e.g.\, @ferraoSensoryPhenomenaAssociated2012; @eckerIncompletenessHarmAvoidance2008].
An association between these phenomena and other anxiety disorders has also been found [@michelEmotionalDistressTolerance2016].
Indeed, distress tolerance has been shown to correlate with psychopathology [@leyroDistressTolerancePsychopathological2010] and has been suggested as a treatment target in various contexts, such as smoking cessation [@brownUncertaintyAnxietyAvoidance2022] and borderline personality disorder [@linehanCognitivebehavioralTreatmentBorderline1993].

<!--
The concept of distress tolerance is fundamentally different from the concept of "intolerable distress" discussed in inhibitory learning models [@craskeOptimizingExposureTherapy2022].
"Intolerable distress" refers to situations where the client expects to become physically or mentally incapable of functioning in the face of distress, often associated with values of control or survival, thus highlighting the importance of harm avoidance.
In contrast, distress tolerance involves the inherent difficulty in tolerating discomfort, without an expected adverse outcome.
-->

Distress tolerance has been suggested as a prime trans-diagnostic process to target in emotional disorders [@barlowUnifiedProtocolTransdiagnostic2010].
We extend this model by emphasizing harm avoidance as a parallel mechanism.
The face-to-face experiments, both the OCD sample and the transdiagnostic sample, revealed a high proportion of distress tolerance proximal threats and a low proportion of distress tolerance core threats.
This finding suggests that even when distress tolerance is evident, harm avoidance is likely to play a significant role in anxiety.
In other words, besides the difficulty in dealing with distress itself, there is the issue of disconfirming underlying threats [@craskeOptimizingExposureTherapy2022].

When designing transdiagnostic interventions, it is important to address different underlying processes [@hofmannFutureInterventionScience2019].
While distress tolerance has received considerable attention, we argue that harm avoidance, particularly core threats, should also be considered a critical adition [@steimerBiologyFearAnxietyrelated2002; @foaEmotionalProcessingFear1986; @beckCognitiveTherapyCurrent2011].

## Core Threats in OCD

Much of the original work on core threats originated in the OCD literature [@huppertCoreFearsValues2012; @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012], and thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that core threats are particularly important for this population.
Indeed, the OCD sample was found to differ from the transdiagnostic samples in several ways.
First, it was the only experiment where proximal threats did not predict core threats at all.
Second, it was the only experiment where core threats were significantly more diverse than proximal threats.
Third, there was a disproportionate prevalence of distress tolerance proximal threats but not of core threats.
All of these findings emphasize the importance of identifying core threats in OCD.

The differences from transdiagnostic anxious samples can be attributed to the intrinsic diversity of OCD, which is known to manifest in various forms.
However, this distinction may also be due to the fact that this was the only validated pathological sample in this series of experiments.
Further research is necessary to explore these differences in more detail.

## Limitations and Further Research

Core threats have been theorized to play a central role in the generalization of threat [see @zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
If this is indeed the case, we would expect the same core threats to motivate multiple different proximal threats.
In the current study, we found some non-significant initial evidence that one core threat can underlie multiple proximal threats.
If this finding is confirmed with further research, it would suggest that safety learning targeting core threats could be a more effective intervention for anxiety disorders.
This notion would be strengthened further by demonstrating better generalization for core threat-focused learning [see @pinciottiCallActionRecommendations2021; @murrayExtinctionTheoryAnorexia2016].
However, the current dataset is too small to reach definitive conclusions, and further study with a larger sample size is needed.

To investigate the agreement between threats, we needed to codify them.
As no existing typology fully suited our needs, we developed one specifically for this study.
While this typology has not yet been validated, and there is a possibility of over-dividing certain categories (e.g., safety and physical discomfort) or under-dividing others (e.g., affiliation), we believe it is sufficient for exploring the associations between different threats.
Nonetheless, further psychometric work is needed to establish a robust and validated typology for core threats.

The CTSI attempts to identify the ultimate underlying threat, but it is not clear if it succeeds.
The stopping criteria used in the CTSI are accepted in the field [see @daveyCatastrophisingInterviewProcedure2006].
However, there is no guarantee that the true motivation is identified.
For example, should one stop at "I will die," or ask further to discover that the fear is of burning in hell?
And is burning in hell the correct stopping point, or should one delve deeper?
The instructions in the CTSI are to stop once the patient can no longer find any deeper meaning, repeat themselves, or once they start getting further from the underlying threat, as evidenced by lower levels of distress.
Ultimately, this question remains open and subjective to the discretion of the interviewer.
We argue that, despite the inherent noise in the process, the answers obtained are at least better than plain proximal threats, even if they do not reach the "true" core threat.

We know from several studies that core threats are deceptively diverse [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
For instance, Greenberg and colleagues [-@greenbergEgocentricAllocentricFears2018] examined whether the underlying fear in olfactory reference syndrome centers on embarrassing oneself or offending others.
They found that individuals possess both types of motivations, regardless of their cultural background (Western vs. Eastern).
Moreover, about a quarter of participants reported a completely unexpected concern: whether the odor indicated a medical condition.
This highlights the importance of investigating idiosyncratic fears expressed by individuals, beyond the stereotypical fears associated with specific disorders.
However, we hypothesize that different disorders exhibit distinct patterns of core threats.
For example, safety is a prominent concern in panic disorder and OCD but appears less central in social anxiety disorder, where competence and affiliation often take precedence.
Similarly, morality plays a significant role in OCD but is less pronounced in other disorders.
Thus, variability in core threats reflects both systematic, disorder-specific tendencies and individual idiosyncrasies.
Future research should focus on mapping these associations more comprehensively.

An additional limitation of this study is the low prevalence of predictability core threats.
Our clinical experience indicates that such core threats should be more prevalent (though not quite as prevalent as other motivators).
It is likely that the focus of the CTSI on specific harm-avoidance type outcomes may have masked such core threats.
For example, some people that fear having cancer are particularly bothered by the inherent fuzziness of the situation - that they can never know for sure.
When asked what they fear, they would focus on the cancer, but that is in face over-shooting the actual motivating core threat.
To address this problem we recommend that interviewers review the downward arrow and explicitly ask what the worst outcome would be.

## Implications for Clinical Practice and Future Research

The findings of this study have implications for both clinical practice and future research.
Clinically, the Core Threat Structured Interview (CTSI) proves to be a valuable tool in uncovering the underlying fears that drive anxiety disorders, facilitating the development of more effective, tailored treatment plans.
This aligns with the work of Persons [@personsCaseFormulationApproach2012], who emphasized the importance of individualized case formulations in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

For future research, these findings open new avenues for exploring the mechanisms underlying the stability of core threats and their impact on treatment outcomes.
The fact that the CTSI includes a self-administered, online version that appears to be reliable and valid should allow significant further research.
We contend that one major limiting factor of studying core threats to date has been the absence of such a tool.
Investigating the interaction between core threats and other psychological constructs, such as resilience and coping strategies, could further enhance our understanding of anxiety disorders and inform more comprehensive treatment approaches.

In conclusion, this study underscores the potential critical role of core threats in anxiety disorders and provides a valid and reliable structured approach to identifying and addressing these threats in clinical practice.
By focusing on the underlying fears that drive surface threats, clinicians might be able to develop more effective interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
